# translationApp_CS4540
Intended to translate phrases/words of text from one language to another. The user will need to input three things which are: the language they want to translate from, the language they want to translate to and the text they want to translate. This text can be accessed within another tab in the app and be viewed as a list where the user can delete any entry and 'star' them as their favorite, so they appear at the top of the list for easier access.

This app is targeted for people that want to learn a different language, as it can be tedious for them to review phrases or words they learned on google translate because they would need to re-type the phrase/word several times to review.
